            <h1>Particle Swarm Optimization</h1>
            <p>
                Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an optimization technique based on the
                behaviors of flocks of birds or schools of fish. This method of optimization uses a
                population of particles to search a space and attempt to find the global maximum
                value to its given fitness function. In each iteration of the population, the
                velocity of a particle is determined based on its current velocity, its personal
                best solution, and the population’s best solution so far. The population's
                positions are then updated using these velocity values, and the personal bests and
                global best positions are updated. The iteration of this population slowly steps
                the population towards some local maximum of the solution space (ideally the global
                maximum). The goal of this project was to explore PSO’s and how their performance
                is affected by the input hyper-parameters of population size, inertia, cognitive
                weight, and social weight.
