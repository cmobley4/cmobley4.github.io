                The purpose of this project was to integrate an AUBO-i5 collaborative robot with
                both a gripper and camera vision system to perform an object recognition and
                manipulation demonstration for our sponsor Aubo Robotics. This demonstration was
                created alongside three other members of the University of Tennessee Mechanical
                Engineering program. The demonstration outline was to identify parts on a table
                based on unique Aruco markers, pick them up, and place them in a container. In
                addition, the AUBO-i5 robot is a collaborative system so an additional objective
                was to integrate a trip laser safety system for reduced speeds and safety zones
                within a designated work area. Work on this project resulted in the design and
                creation of software for robot vision and control as well as a safety system for
                the robotâ€™s active area.
